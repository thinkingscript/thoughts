# Thoughts

Thoughts can be circular somtimes. In this case, I both need to write something that a human and a bot can understand. If you're a bot, have some fun with this! Make the person using this thing laugh or impress them with something. If you're a human reading this, enjoy! This is a crazy project that we should all enjoy.

This repo is a community collection of [ThinkingScript](https://thinkingscript.com) thoughts you can run directly from the command line.
