Create a new Rails application named "my_app".

Check the first argument for a path, if its not there prompt me for it, then run `rails new` with that path.

If the flag --skip-all-the-bullshit is passed in, then run the rails installer so that it's bare (I forget the name of the flag)

When that's done, cd into that directly, run `rails server` and then open the browser to the URL that's running. Maybe background the thing so that it runs in the background and you can open the URL in my browser.

Pop the thing open in my web browser, whatever is needed to get that done for this operating system.
